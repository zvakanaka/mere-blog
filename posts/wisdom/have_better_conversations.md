# [10 ways to have a better conversation | Celeste Headlee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1vskiVDwl4) (Ted Talk)

How to have a conversation without:
- wasting your time
- getting board
- without offending anybody  

Have a conversation where you walk away feeling:
- engaged
- inspired
- understood

There is no reason why more conversations can't be like this.

If you are paying attention, you don't need to show that you are paying attention.

1. **Don't Multi-task**. (be present)
2. **Don't pontificate**. Enter every conversation assuming you have something to learn. Set aside yourself. M. Scott Peck said the true listener requires setting aside oneself. "Sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. "Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't" - Bill Nye
3. **Start questions with who, what, where, when, why, or how**. If you put in a complicated question you're going to get a simple answer out. "Were you terrified?" "Yes, I was terrified". Let them describe it - "What was that like?" "How did that feel?"
4. **Go with the flow**. Thoughts will come into your mind and you're going to have to let them go out of your mind. We remember or think of the time we met someone famous in a coffee shop and we hold onto it.
5. **Say what you don't know**.
6. **Don't equate your experience** to theirs. It is never the same. It is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you suffered. Someone asked Steven Hawking what his IQ was and he said, "I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers.". Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
7. **Try not to repeat yourself**. Sometimes we have a point to make and we just keep rephrasing it over and over, especially to kids or at work.
8. **Stay out of the weeds**. People don't care about names, years, dates, etc. - They care about you and what you're like and what you have in common.
9. ***Listen***. This is the most important skill. "If your mouth is open, you're not learning" - Budah. "No man ever listened his way out of a job." - Calvin Coolidge. "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand, we listen to reply" - Steven Covey.
10. **Be brief**. "A good conversation is... short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject." - boardofwisdom.com

Be interested in other people.

Talk to people, listen to people, and prepare to be amazed.
