# Tracking a Lost Package
5 months ago, a package came to my local post office that I ordered from AliExpress. However, it couldn't be delivered, with the reason of "Delivery failed. Delivery unsuccessful". When viewing the detailed tracking, it shows the final steps of "Arrived at Post Office", "Out for Delivery", "Insufficient Address", and finally "Delivery Attempt Failure". I went to the post office about a month later and they said they no longer had the package. 5 months later, I called 1-800-ASK-USPS and said "package" (press 1), "number", and "yes" for smartphone and used the "Visual mode" feature to open a link in a web browser and paste the tracking number. Even though the package is non-perishable as far as I know, the system told me it was disposed of. I also contacted the AliExpress sellers about 2 months after it arrived, and they did not refund me, as it was now in the hands of my country. It was less than $30. I made another order recently, and while travelling used the same method to check the tracking number and was able to confirm that it did arrive at my mailbox.
